# freecodecamp
This repository contains my code for freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python certificate course's capstone projects.
Projects in this repository include an Arithmetic Formatter, a Time Calculator, a Budget App, a Polygon Area Calculator and a Probability Calculator.

**Project Details:**
This repository has the following files with descriptions below: Arithmetic_Formatter.py, Budget_App.py, Polygon_Area_Calculator.py, Probability_Calculator.py, and Time_Calculator.py

Each file in this library is stand-alone and can be run by itself. 

<b>Arithmetic Formatter:</b> This program receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.

<b>Time Calculator:</b> This program takes a tie and can add a duration to the time and return the resulting time.

<b>Budget App:</b> This program tracks user created categories of spending and outputs a simple spending chart bar graph to visualize amounts spent.

<b>Polygon Area Calculator:</b> This program contains some simple classes defining Rectangles and Squares and provides methods to calculate their area, perimeter etc. 

<b>Probability Calculator:</b> This program acts a probability simulator for a combinatorics maths. The program simulates colors balls drawn from a hat with user input on the number of balls of each color and runs simulations to determine the approximate probability of drawing a specific set of balls.

**Dependencies**
Files in this repository require Python's regular expressions, copy, random, and math libraries.
