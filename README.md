# freecodecamp
This reposistory contains my code for freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python certificate course's capstone projects.
Projects in this repository include an Arithmetic Formatter, a Time Calculator, a Budget App, a Polygon Area Calculator and a Probability Calculator.

**Project Details:**

Arithmetic Formatter: This program receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.

Time Calculator: This program can add a duration to a start time and return the result.

Budget App: This program tracks user created categories of spending and outputs a spending chart to visualize amounts spent.

Polygon Area Calculator: This program has classes defining Rectangles and Squares and provides methods to calculate their area, perimeter etc. 

Probability Calculator: This program simulates colors balls drawn from a hat with user input on the number of balls of each color and runs simulations to determine the approximate probability of drawing a specific set of balls.
